Smallsat Data Explorer
Search, discover, and access NASA acquired commercial smallsat data.

The Smallsat Data Explorer is being developed as part of NASA's Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) 
Program to search, discover, and access commercial small satellite (or smallsat) data that has been acquired by NASA.

The CSDA Program is committed to identifying and evaluating commercial smallsat data that have the potential to support 
NASA’s Earth science research and application activities. Currently, this tool supports search, discovery, 
and access to data from Planet Labs, Inc. and Spire Global, Inc. acquired as part of the CSDA Program’s evaluation 
effort and ongoing collaborations. Data access is restricted to researchers of NASA-funded projects.
Approved users can leverage this tool to query the current archive over a specified date range by selecting or 
uploading areas of interest (AOI).
